\title{Quantify group specificity of entire communities for each sample}
\usage{
specifiR(
  comm,
  groups,
  seed = 666,
  n.perm = 999,
  pval.cutoff = 0.05,
  max.ratio = 0,
  ovp.plot = FALSE,
  rm.rare.taxa = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{Data frame. Data frame (or coercible to "data.frame") of community abundance values. Rows are samples, columns are taxa. Values are raw observation numbers.}

\item{groups}{Character. Vector of grouping levels. Must be same length as number of samples (rows) of comm.}

\item{seed}{Numeric of length 1. Random seed for reproducibility. Default = 666.}

\item{n.perm}{Positive numeric (integer) of length 1. Number of permutations for Monte Carlo permutation test. Default = 999.}

\item{pval.cutoff}{Positive numeric of length 1, between 0 and 1. The P-value cutoff for significance. Default = 0.05.}

\item{max.ratio}{The maximum ratio of significant:insignificant P-values within a group to indicate removal. Taxa with fidelity to groups at or less than this value will be removed. Only the first N occurence groups that have this value or lower will be flagged for taxon removal. Default = 0. You are unlikely to want to change this value.}

\item{ovp.plot}{Logical. Should a plot of occupancy vs. p-values be generated? Default = FALSE.}

\item{rm.rare.taxa}{Logical. Should rare taxa be removed before the CWM? Default = TRUE. Set to FALSE if you want to perform the Community Weighted Mean analysis on all taxa.}
}
\value{
Named List. This returns a list with 5 elements:
community_specificity_index = The main result showing community weighted mean indicator values for each sample;
taxon_specificity_index = Intermediate result (`comm_name` `iv.max` `p.value` `occurrence` `occurrence_groups` `taxon_index`);
isa_results = Intermediate results. taxon-level indicator species analysis with each given group level, and the indicator results for each taxon;
process_summary = Reports basic info on process, including the number of taxa removed due to rarity;
removed_taxa = Character vector with names of taxa removed due to rarity.
