# Main steps

  1. recreate output from PC-ORD indicator analysis
    - calculate indicator values
      (relabund * fidelity * 100)
    - identify max indicator value for each taxon (IVmax)
    - randomization test (probability of IVmax >= found in randomized data)
    - quantify taxon-level specificity (1 - pvalue)
  2. identify threshold for removing rare taxa
    - how can we automate this?
    - or allow user choice of thresholds?
  3. community weighted mean


# Action items:

  - Abbey will send data and current code
  - I will run through the workflow and:
    - identify which functions we need
    - figure out parameters/variables for them
    - build a shell of the package on GitHub (add Abbey as contributor)
  - We then need to try it out with other data to find the breaking points
  - What will users want to do differently? (give them the flexibility)
